#### a. Overview

- **WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)** standards define the specifications for wireless communication between devices.
- Common standards include IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6).

#### b. Key Standards

1. **802.11a:**
    
    - Operates in the 5 GHz frequency band.
    - Offers higher data rates but has shorter range compared to 802.11b and g.
2. **802.11b:**
    
    - Operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.
    - Slower data rates compared to 802.11a but provides better range.
3. **802.11g:**
    
    - Operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.
    - Combines the speed of 802.11a with the range of 802.11b.
4. **802.11n:**
    
    - Operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.
    - Introduces multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) technology for improved performance.
5. **802.11ac:**
    
    - Operates in the 5 GHz frequency band.
    - Offers higher data rates and improved performance over 802.11n.
6. **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6):**
    
    - The latest standard, designed for high-efficiency wireless communication.
    - Operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, with increased capacity and faster data rates.

#### c. Considerations

- WLAN standards determine compatibility and performance.
- Choosing the right standard depends on factors such as data rate requirements, range, and interference.
